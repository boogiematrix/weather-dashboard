# weather-dashboard

This is a basic weather app. Using data from the [OpenWeather Api](https://openweathermap.org/api) and a user's chosen location the page generates a display of the current weather at that location as well as the weather for five days at that location. The user's search history is stored and generated as a list that can be clicked on to recall past weather data.
